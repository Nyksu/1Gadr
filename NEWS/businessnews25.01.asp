      Customer Service Level Agreements For Largest Internet Services Provider 
      in Chile</td>
      
    <td colspan="2"> 
      <p><font size="2">SAN FRANCISCO – Micromuse Inc. (Nasdaq: MUSE), the leading 
        provider of realtime fault management and service assurance software, 
        today announced that ENTEL S.A. has selected Netcool® applications to 
        provide realtime monitoring of service availability and response times 
        for its rapidly expanding Internet network. Entel provides a complete 
        suite of Internet communications services in targeted markets throughout 
        Chile. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">“As the Chilean telco market space becomes more competitive, 
        it was important for Entel to be able to monitor our customer’s network 
        service levels and allow them to understand the services they are offering 
        from the user’s perspective,” said Cesar Abuauad, Director of Internet 
        Services of Entel, Chile. “Our customers expect us to provide the best 
        products on the market to help them offer higher levels of service to 
        their own customers. Netcool’s rapid deployment and highly scaleable service 
        assurance capabilities are helping us become more proactive when it comes 
        to meeting our customers needs.” </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In addition to Netcool/OMNIbus™, Micromuse’s flagship 
        application, Entel will also deploy Netcool/Internet Service Monitors™ 
        (Netcool/ISMs) to provide realtime Internet service availability and response 
        time information for 18 different Internet protocols and applications 
        including RADIUS, DNS, HTTP and FTP. Netcool/ISMs help commercial and 
        non-commercial Internet service providers improve the manageability of 
        their Internet connections, corporate intranets, and extranets by regularly 
        testing each service at user-defined intervals. The data provided by Netcool/ISMs 
        can be easily graphed against pre-defined service-level metrics to help 
        Entel obtain realtime and historical evidence of service levels. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Once deployed, the Netcool applications will help Entel 
        monitor its Internet Access Services simulating customers accessing the 
        Internet through either analog and ISDN modems or dedicated connections 
        (leased line, Frame Relay, etc.). Netcool/ISMs will be distributed in 
        different cities across the country to determine if the same Quality of 
        Service (QoS) is provided to any customer. </font>
      <p><font size="2">“As Latin American Telco markets have deregulated, providers 
        have had to deal with the shift from being a monopoly to competing for 
        customers,” said Adrian Rowland, Micromuse’s Director Internet Strategies. 
        “They need business tools to help them understand the service levels they 
        are providing their clients. Micromuse’s Netcool suite gives them information 
        as to which customers are affected and which services are being affected, 
        precisely where the problem is located and then it suggests the best way 
        to fix it.” </font>
      <p><font size="2">Additionally, Entel selected Netcool/Reporter™, a highly 
        flexible reporting tool, to provide internal users, such as operational, 
        marketing and executives, with varied information views in order to help 
        improve QoS. AMR Telecomunicaciones, Micromuse’s authorized systems integrator 
        in Chile, will handle implementation and support of the Netcool solution 
        for Entel. </font>

                collects management data from more than 300 management environments 
                and network devices, including voice, data and Internet. Fault 
                data is rapidly processed and filtered by the Netcool ObjectServer™, 
                an in-memory database. The Netcool application helps operators 
                to build views of service availability in realtime, helping them 
                manage networks more efficiently. Because it is scalable and deploys 
                rapidly, the Netcool suite helps service providers to expand their 
                networks as their markets grow.</font></div>
