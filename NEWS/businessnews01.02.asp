      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN CARLOS, CA - February 
        1, 2001 (INB) -- Charitableway today announced that during this past fall, 
        the company managed 12 major electronic workplace giving campaigns resulting 
        in over $13 million in contributions to charities, over $500,000 of which 
        was pledged in a single day. The company has also worked with United Way 
        Silicon Valley during this past year to support paper-based campaigns 
        for over one thousand companies of all sizes totaling over $23 million 
        in contributions. http://www.charitableway.com</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A dozen national corporations, 
        including Fortune 1000 companies, leading high technology businesses, 
        and financial institutions successfully used Charitableway's automated 
        Workplace Giving CenterTM last year. These campaigns reached more than 
        162,000 donors. These organizations pioneered outsourcing the process 
        management of their giving campaigns, allowing them to save time and internal 
        resources while implementing a simplified, complete, and convenient system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ceridian employees 
        all over the country are very involved in supporting the United Way and 
        its member agencies, and the company is proud to offer a workplace giving 
        program to support this involvement," said Kathleen Fahnhorst, Manager, 
        Work/Life and Public Affairs for Ceridian Corporation. "Charitableway 
        provided us with a more efficient way to run our campaign. The system 
        was easy to implement and the service and support from Charitableway was 
        outstanding."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contrary to much of 
        conventional wisdom about electronic giving, results of a customer survey 
        conducted by Burke Research for Charitableway showed that the employees 
        who used the automated giving systems found it quick, easy, convenient, 
        and private: </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">o Only 12 percent 
        of users had donated online previously. o 85 percent reported that they 
        were as satisfied or more satisfied with the online donation process than 
        they were with donating via paper pledge systems. o 75 percent reported 
        that they felt the same or higher levels of confidence in the security 
        and privacy of their pledges. o Feelings of engagement, generosity, and 
        appreciation were the same as they were with paper campaigns. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly 90 percent 
        of Fortune 1000 companies conduct employee-based workplace charitable 
        giving campaigns that are estimated to have generated over $4 billion 
        in donations to charities last year. The Workplace Giving Center is the 
        first business tool designed specifically to meet all of the requirements 
        that modern corporations have for managing these campaigns effectively 
        and efficiently.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Charitableway was 
        our partner of choice. Our HR/IT department appreciated that outsourcing 
        process management meant that they could stay focused on the business 
        side of things," said Kathleen Franger, Program Manager for Corporate 
        Philanthropy and Community Relations, Hewlett-Packard. "We were pleased 
        to see that the average gift per donor was up by over $100."</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Burke 
        Research customer survey, campaign administrators reported that the top 
        five greatest benefits of using the Workplace Giving Center were the following:</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) the ability to 
        significantly reduce both the costs and staff time by moving from a paper-based 
        campaign to an outsourced technology-based campaign,</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) the ability to 
        centralize the giving campaigns conducted in their various company regional 
        locations while still being able to localize the campaigns by featuring 
        their desired catalog of charitable organizations,</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) the ability to 
        reduce paper pledge process by providing a closed-system electronic giving 
        apparatus for their employees that was linked to their company intranet 
        and securely integrated with their payroll systems,</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) the ability to 
        get money to charities faster through the automated reconciliation of 
        funds donated and disbursement of funds to nonprofit agencies,</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) and, for the first 
        time having the ability to track the results of the campaign online daily 
        rather than waiting for months after the campaign is concluded and receiving 
        reports with information that help them conduct better and more responsive 
        campaigns.</font>
