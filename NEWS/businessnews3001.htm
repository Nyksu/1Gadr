        foremost purveyor of online software, is looking for a few good developers 
        to add to its collection of innovative shareware applications available 
        at www.digitalcandle.com. Developers that sign up with DigitalCandle now 
        through April 2, 2001, will receive all of the benefits of DigitalCandle's 
        Payment Processing and Product Marketing services for only 10% of gross 
        sales with a $2 minimum for the first three months. </p>
      <p>Whether developing software for a hobby or wanting to increases one's 
        cash flow, opportunities exist to profit from innovative shareware products.

        how difficult and time-consuming the process can be. Enter DigitalCandle 
        with a solution to meet the needs of independent software developers.

        traps that await developers," said Casey Vieceli, president and chief 
        executive officer of DigitalCandle Inc. "DigitalCandle provides benefits 
        that essentially give developers a 'leg-up' to succeed in the competitive 
        software market." </p>
      <p>DigitalCandle offers an effective, competitive approach towards generating 
        sales and Increased revenue from independently developed software products. 
        In exchange for services, DigitalCandle receives a percentage of generated
